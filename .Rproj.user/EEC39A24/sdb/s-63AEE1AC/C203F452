The main motivation for writing this theme was to provide a really minimal example to beginners of Hugo templates. This XMin theme contains about 130 lines of code in total, including the code in HTML templates and CSS (also counting empty lines).\n\n \n\n```\n       5 ./layouts/404.html\n      18 ./layouts/_default/list.html\n      12 ./layouts/_default/single.html\n      16 ./layouts/_default/terms.html\n       0 ./layouts/partials/foot_custom.html\n       9 ./layouts/partials/footer.html\n       0 ./layouts/partials/head_custom.html\n      20 ./layouts/partials/header.html\n       7 ./static/css/fonts.css\n      50 ./static/css/style.css\n     137 total\n```\n\nI can certainly further reduce the code, for example, by eliminating the CSS, but I believe a tiny bit CSS can greatly improve readability. You cannot really find many CSS frameworks that only contain 50 lines of code.\n\nAlthough it is a minimal theme, it is actually fully functional. It supports pages (including the home page), blog posts, a navigation menu, categories, tags, and RSS. With [a little bit customization](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/blob/master/exampleSite/layouts/partials/foot_custom.html), it can easily support LaTeX math expressions, e.g.,\n\n`$${\\sqrt {n}}\\left(\\left({\\frac {1}{n}}\\sum _{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\\right)-\\mu \\right)\\ {\\xrightarrow {d}}\\ N\\left(0,\\sigma ^{2}\\right)$$`\n\nAll pages not under the root directory of the website are listed below. You can also visit the list page of a single section, e.g., [posts](/post/), or [notes](/note/). See the [About](/about/) page for the usage of this theme.\n",
